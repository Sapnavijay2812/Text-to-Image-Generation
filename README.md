# Text-to-Image-Generation
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a text-to-image generative model that translates natural language descriptions into high-fidelity images. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and adversarial training, the model generates images that accurately reflect the given textual descriptions. The project includes a user-friendly web interface for practical applications, allowing users to input text and receive corresponding images.
